This project seeks to scrape, filter, craft, and present real estate & storm data for 
the purposes of roofing marketing. 

I'm seeking out data that will help me identify homeowners who need
a new roof, using 2 different datasets, real estate and storm data. 

<strong>In real estate data,  I'll be looking at the data points below:</strong>
  
  -Age of the Home
  -Most Recent Listing
  -Most recent photos of the roof
  -Square footage of the house
  -Values of comprable homes in the same market

Acquiring this data, requires scraping it from a major real estate service. 
In this case, I chose to use Redfin.

In order to scrape the data, you need to...



<strong>In the storm data,  I'll be looking at the data points below:</strong>

    -Areas hit by 1 in. of hail or greater in the past 2 years
    -Areas hit by 60 mph winds or greater in the past 2 years

This data can also be scraped. My first try is going to be with the weatherbhub storm data we subscribe for at the roofing company I work for. But I'm also going to look into some public data.


<strong>Connection Between Real Estate & Storm Data</strong>

Together, this data is meant to help roofing companies locate the best potential 
jobs in the Kentucky/Indiana area. You could use it for marketing purposes in whichever 
area you select data for.

The real estate data helps us determine the best residential roof jobs in the area, and 
the storm data tells us which of them are likely to have their roof covered by their home 
insurance policy. We can identify people who know they need a new roof, and help them uncover 
the best deal.
